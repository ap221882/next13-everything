# next13-everything

templates - rerender on route change different from layout, - useful for animations, or when data fetching during route change is needed

client components - rendered on server but executed on client -- means check for window etc before using
--- We can use server components in client components and vice versa but cant pass non-serializable(functions) props between them

PRISMA - npx prisma migrate dev --name init
